# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### How does it work?
The solution leverages [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/) to create a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) Object watched and understood by the [Terraform Operator](https://github.com/isaaguilar/terraform-operator) which then triggers a workflow that applies a referenced Terraform module. We have aligned these CRD objects to cloud resources that Kubernetes workloads often depend on and published them to [artifacthub.io](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?ts_query_web=appvia). You can either choose one of them or create your own package.

### What are the benefits to this approach?
1. Clear separation of concerns for infrastructure operators and application developers
2. Developer self-service of consumable cloud resource packages with minimal user input
3. Leverages Helm as a package manager and its rich ecosystem
4. Leverages Terraform as the de facto tool for infrastructure provisioning

### What if my cloud resource depends on another?
It is common for a cloud resource to depend on other cloud resources as input arguments when being provisioned. These arguments or cloud resource attributes can be retrieved by querying the cloud API or Terraform state.

Here are some possible ways to address this if you are creating your own package:
1. Create a Terraform module that creates and/or references the dependent cloud resources
2. Create a Terraform module based on organisational boundaries which accepts user inputs and/or sensible default values as arguments  
3. Create a Helm Chart that uses Helm Lookup function to query the Kubernetes API for Terraform outputs generated by dependent Helm Charts stored in a Kubernetes Secret

Each [appvia-community package](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?ts_query_web=appvia) represents a single cloud resource with some appropriate default parameters which follows the second option and allows consumers to add minimal input.

### How is the state managed?
Terraform includes a built-in [selection of backends](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends) which define where Terraform's state snapshots are stored. You can choose your preferred backend when [creating your own package](creating-your-own-packages.md). The Terraform Operator instructs the Terraform runner Pods to store state in a [Consul KV store](https://github.com/isaaguilar/terraform-operator/blob/v0.5.1/terraform-runner/backend.tf) by default.

You will be responsible for managing the Consul cluster if you choose to use this backend. However, we recommend using the Kubernetes backend as it is the simplest option to get started. Each [appvia-community package](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?ts_query_web=appvia) uses this backend which persists state into a Kubernetes Secret within a user-defined Kubernetes Namespace.

Some key points surrounding the usage of the Kubernetes backend:
- It supports state locking which means that Terraform will lock the state for all operations that write state
- It is limited by Kubernetes' maximum Secret size of 1MB which must be considered when creating larger Terraform modules
- The Terraform runner Pods store sensitive data as plaintext in Kubernetes Secrets
- The Terraform runner Pods only have access to Kubernetes Secrets in the Namespace where the Terraform CRD object is created

### Which cloud resources can I self-serve today?
