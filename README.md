Terranetes enables application developers to self-serve cloud resources with minimal user input using Helm packages.

It is a solution and pattern that simplifies developer self-service and application development in the cloud. It combines reputable and widely-adopted technologies such as HashiCorp Terraform, the Appvia Terraform Controller and Helm to provide consumable packages (i.e. Helm charts) to application developers. Terraform and Helm are the core components of this pattern, but the Terraform Controller component can replaced with alternative solutions such as the Open Application Model Terraform Controller.

It is a way of working that empowers infrastructure operators such as DevOps or Platform engineers to create consistent and re-usable Terraform modules that application developers can consume with minimal user input and minimal cloud expertise, whilst being assured they are inline of company policies and budgets.
