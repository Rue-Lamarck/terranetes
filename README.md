# Terranetes

Terranetes enables application developers to self-serve cloud resources with minimal user input using Helm packages. You can either choose from our list of packages available on [artifacthub.io](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?ts_query_web=appvia) or adopt our pattern to build out your own packages.

It is a solution and pattern that simplifies developer self-service and application development in the cloud. It combines reputable and widely-adopted technologies such as [HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Terraform Operator](https://github.com/isaaguilar/terraform-operator) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/) to provide consumable packages i.e. Helm charts to application developers.

This means that infrastructure operators such as DevOps or Platform engineers create consistent and re-usable Terraform modules whilst application developers consume those Terraform modules with minimal user input and minimal cloud expertise.
